Hi! so you may be wondering what this is, and basically its an autosplitter for ratchet: deadlocked HD. It probably will work fine with the SD copy but i havent tried and barely anyone uses it anyway. 

This is not a tutorial, you can find info for that at https://github.com/Toufool/AutoSplit I have left the program in this folder though

The point of this is to give you a setup kit, so you should be able to just magic wand my image in paint.net, and then layer it over your own screenshot to get the right cropping and stuff. 

I've also left my reset image in the reference pictures folder, this should help you see how I made mine. Its the load menu, and i just make the AS only look for my username, which I purposefully made long.
